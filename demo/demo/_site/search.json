    "text": "Introduction Why should we care about the connection between economic growth and gender equality? It’s a big question! As we explore today’s global challenges, we can see how economies and societies are woven together—economic growth isn’t just about numbers; it impacts lives, opportunities, and well-being. One aspect we’re especially curious about is gender equality: Does a stronger economy mean more equal opportunities for all genders? Our main research question is: How might changes in Real GDP per capita predict changes in the Gender Inequality Index (GII) across different countries? Our hypothesis is that economic growth should support progress in gender equality: as GDP per capita increases, the GII decreases, signaling improvements in equality. We decided to dig into the data to find out. Using Promptly Technologies’s open-source Python library Imfp, our aim is to see if there’s a real, measurable connection between the two variables. Ready for some insights? Spoiler alert: our results didn’t exactly match our hypothesis, but they did open up fascinating questions about what really drives gender equality beyond just economic growth. Let’s dive in!\nData Preparation ​​To explore how economic growth connects with gender equality, we turned to the Imfp library to access a wealth of global economic data, ready to analyze through some straightforward API calls. Let’s break down our two main variables of interest. Here’s the lowdown on the 4 key data series we pulled together:\nDependent Variable: Percent Change in Gender Inequality Index (GII) Our gender equality measure, the Gender Inequality Index (GII), is a composite score that reflects inequality in three key areas: reproductive health, empowerment, and labor market, ranging from 0 (equality) to 1 (inequality). We calculated the percent change in GII over time to make it easier to compare GII change across countries with different baseline levels of inequality.\nIndependent Variable: Percent Change in Real GDP per capita Our economic growth measure is real GDP per capita, an indicator of a country’s economic output per person, adjusted for inflation. The higher the real GDP per capita, the wealthier and more prosperous a country is. Here is a peek at the formula:\nData Visualization Scatterplot\nNothing like a good scatterplot to help us understand the relationship between two numbers, right? For our project, the scatterplot lets us visually explore how Percent Change in Real GDP per capita relates to Percent Change in GII. Each dot on the plot represents a country-year combo. The gentle upward slope suggests that in years of low GDP growth, gender inequality tends to decrease a bit faster, while in years of high GDP growth, the inequality drops at a slightly slower rate. It’s a subtle clue, but slower-growing economies might be making slightly quicker strides in gender equality. Time Series Line plot\nThe time series line plot gives us the big picture of GDP and GII changes over time across a few select countries, including the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, France, and Mexico. Mexico, for example, saw great GDP swings in 1995, yet its GII stayed relatively stable. Meanwhile, Japan and France saw some dramatic GII shifts. These fluctuations leave us wondering: what historical events sparked these changes? We may need to take a deeper look into each country’s unique timeline to find the answers.\nBoxplot\nNext, we have the boxplot to help us visualize the distribution. By sequencing countries in ascending order of median GDP change, we see an interesting trend: countries with higher median GDP growth also seem to show more variability in their GDP changes. The GII change, on the other hand, keeps a relatively stable median, hinting at a weaker association with GDP growth.\nHeatmap\nFinally, our heatmap wraps it all up with a quick, intuitive look at correlations between GDP and GII across countries. In countries like Estonia (EE) and Ireland (IE), Australia (AT), South Africa (ZA), Thailand (TH), Slovenia (SI), we see positive correlations in warm colors, indicating that as GDP growth rates increase, GII growth rates tend to rise as well. For countries like Cyprus (CY), Romania (RO), and the United States (US), we see cooler colors, representing negative correlations: as GDP growth rate rises, GII growth rates decrease, suggesting an improvement in gender equality alongside economic growth. This color-coded comparison leaves us curious—could the distinction between developed and developing countries play a role in these relationships? It’s a question that might inspire future research directions!\nStatistical Analysis Descriptive Statistics Let’s start with a quick overview of our descriptive statistics: our dataset includes 915 data points. On average, GII change is -3.15%, indicating an overall reduction in gender inequality over time. Meanwhile, GDP change averages 2.35%, hinting at modest economic growth. A full breakdown of these values can be found in the table below for more detail.\nRegression Analysis To get a sense of any relationship between GDP change and GII change, we ran a simple linear regression. Here’s what we found: P-value: With a p-value of 0.057, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is no statistically significant relationship. In other words, we don’t find strong evidence of a link between GDP and GII changes. R-squared: GDP change explains only 0.4% of the variation in GII change—a pretty minimal effect. 95% Confidence Interval: We’re 95% confident the interval from -0.003 to 0.169 captures the true slope. The effect of GDP change on GII is uncertain as 0 is within this range.\nTime Series Analysis Time series analysis allows us to dig deeper into how GII and GDP changes play out over time—and potentially influence one another. Here’s the rundown: Stationarity check: Both GII and GDP change series are stationary, meaning their means and variances are stable over time, setting us up for reliable forecasting. VAR Model (Vector Autoregression): This multivariate model lets us explore how past values in both series relate to current values. Notably, past GII changes significantly impact current GII changes. Model Performance: The VAR model has good fit, as shown by the forecast closely tracking actual values. Low MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) confirm that our model predicts GII and GDP change with minimal error. Check out the plots and table below! Granger Causality Test: Curious whether GDP changes can predict changes in GII? The Granger causality test says no. With p-values above 0.05, we fail to find evidence that GDP changes drive GII changes. This suggests that while both variables evolve over time, they don’t seem to directly influence each other.\nConclusion In wrapping up our analysis, we found no evidence to support a significant relationship between the Change in Real GDP per capita and the Change in the Gender Inequality Index (GII). This suggests that economic growth may not have a direct impact on gender equality. However, our findings open the door to questions for future research. In terms of the Imfp library, we gained valuable experience working with real-world economic indicators like GDP and the GII. The library’s function in fetching databases, parameters, and datasets made it straightforward to access IMF’s data, allowing us to focus on analysis instead. The integration of other Python tools—such as seaborn, matplotlib, and numpy—not only streamlined our computational processes but also ensured consistency across the project. Future Directions First, we must consider what other factors might influence the relationship between GDP and GII change. The GII is a composite index, shaped by a myriad of social factors, including cultural norms, legal frameworks, and environmental shifts. Future studies could benefit from incorporating additional predictors into the analysis and exploring the interaction between economic growth and gender equality within specific country contexts. Second, there’s potential to enhance the predictive power of our Vector Autoregression (VAR) time series model. While we established that GDP change does not cause GII change, our model performed well in forecasting trends for both variables independently. In practice, policymakers may want to forecast GII trends independently of GDP if they are implementing gender-focused policies. Future research could investigate time series modeling to further unravel the dynamics of GII and GDP changes. So, as we wrap up this chapter, let’s keep our curiosity alive and our questions flowing. After all, every end is just a new beginning in the quest for knowledge!"

For example, in Mexico, when there was a big change in real GDP per captia in 1995, the change in GII was pretty stable.\n\n# Time Series Line plot for a few key countries\nselected_countries  = ['US', 'JP', 'GB', 'FR', 'MX']\ncombined_data_selected = combined_data[combined_data['Country'].isin(selected_countries)]\n\n# Set up the Plot Structure\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize=(18, 10), sharex=True)\n\n# Plot change in real GDP per capita over time\nsns.lineplot(data = combined_data_selected, x = \"Time\", y = \"GDP_change\", hue = \"Country\", ax = ax[0])\nax[0].set_title(\"Percent Change in Real GDP per Capita Over Time\")\nax[0].set_ylabel(\"Percent Change in Real GDP per Capita\")\n\n# Plot change in GII over time\nsns.lineplot(data = combined_data_selected, x = \"Time\", y = \"GII_change\", hue = \"Country\", ax = ax[1])\nax[1].set_title(\"Percent Change in GII over Time\")\nax[1].set_xlabel(\"Time\")\nax[1].set_ylabel(\"GII\")\n\nplt.tight_layout\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBarplot\nWe used a barplot to show average changes in GII and GDP percent change for each country to visualize regions where inequality was improving or worsening.\nThis plot supported our previous observation how GII change seemed to be not be correlated with GDP change. We also saw that, for country SI, Solvenia, there seems to be a large improvement in gender inequality.\n\n# Barplot using average GII and GDP change\n# Calculate average change for each country\ncombined_data_avg = combined_data.groupby('Country')[['GII_change','GDP_change']].mean().reset_index()\n\n# Prepare to plot structure \nplt.figure(figsize = (18,10))\n\n# Create the barplot\ncombined_data_avg.plot(kind = 'bar', x = 'Country')\nplt.ylabel('Average Change')\nplt.xlabel('Country')\nplt.legend(['GII change', 'GDP change'])\nplt.grid(axis = 'y')\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()\n\n&lt;Figure size 1728x960 with 0 Axes&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoxplot\nWe used boxplot to visualize the distribution of GDP and GII change by country, providing information about spread, median, and potential outliers. To provide a more informative view, we sequenced countries in an ascending order by the median of percent change in GDP.\nThe boxplot displayed a slight upward trend with no obvious pattern between GDP and GII change. In coutries with higher GDP change median, they also tend to have a larger spread of the GDP change. The median of GII change remained stable regardless of the magnitude of GDP change, implying weak or no association between GDP and GII change. We observed a potential outlier for country SI, Solvenia, which may explained its large improvement in Gender inequality.\n\n# Box plot for GII and GDP change\n# Melt the dataframe to long format for combined boxplot\ncombined_data_melted = combined_data.melt(id_vars=['Country'], value_vars=['GII_change', 'GDP_change'], \n                                          var_name='Change_Type', value_name='Value')\n\ngdp_medians = combined_data.groupby('Country')['GDP_change'].median().sort_values()\n\ncombined_data_melted['Country'] = pd.Categorical(combined_data_melted['Country'], categories=gdp_medians.index, ordered= True)\n\n# Prepare the plot structure\nplt.figure(figsize=(18, 10))\nsns.boxplot(data = combined_data_melted, x = \"Country\", y = 'Value', hue = 'Change_Type')\nplt.title('Distribution of GII and GDP change by Country')\nplt.xlabel('Country')\nplt.ylabel('Change')\nplt.legend(title = 'Change Type')\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrelation Matrix\nWe created a heatmap to show the relationship between GII and GDP change.\nA positive correlation coefficient indicates a positive relationship: the larger the GDP change, the larger the GII change. A negative correlation coefficient indicates a negative relationship: the larger the GDP change, the smaller the GII change. A correlation coefficient closer to 0 indicates there is weak or no relationship.\nBased on the numeric values in the plot, there was a moderately strong positive correlation between GII and GDP change for country Estonia(EE) and Ireland(IE).\n\n# Calculate the correlation\ncountry_correlation = combined_data.groupby('Country')[['GII_change', 'GDP_change']].corr().iloc[0::2, -1].reset_index(name='Correlation')\n\n# Put the correlation value in a matrix format\ncorrelation_matrix = country_correlation.pivot(index='Country', columns='level_1', values='Correlation')\n\n# Check for NaN values in the correlation matrix\ncorrelation_matrix.fillna(0, inplace=True)  # Replace NaNs with 0 or another value as appropriate\n\n# Set up the plot structure\nplt.figure(figsize=(18, 12))  # Adjust height to give more space for y-axis labels\n\n# Plot the heatmap\nsns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', center=0, cbar_kws={\"shrink\": .8}, linewidths=.5)\n\n# Enhance axis labels and title\nplt.title('Heatmap for GII and GDP Change', fontsize=20)\nplt.xlabel('Variables', fontsize=16)\nplt.ylabel('Country', fontsize=16)\n\n# Improve readability of y-axis labels\nplt.yticks(fontsize=12)  # Adjust the font size for y-axis labels\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()"

Only 0.4% of the variance in GII change could be explained by GDP change.\nWe were 95% confident that the interval from -0.003 to 0.169 captured the true slope of GDP change. Because 0 was included, we are uncertain about the effect of GDP change on GII chnage.\n\n\n# Define independent and depenent variables\nX = combined_data['GDP_change']\ny = combined_data['GII_change']\n\n# Add a constant to indepdent variable to include an intercept\nX = sm.add_constant(X)\n\n# Fit a simple linear regresion model and print out the summary\nmodel = sm.OLS(y, X).fit()\nprint(model.summary())\n\n                            OLS Regression Results                            \n==============================================================================\nDep.

We proceeded to the time series modeling section.\n\n# Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test for stationarity check\n# Create melted datasets\ncombined_data_time = combined_data.melt(id_vars=['Time', 'Country'], value_vars=['GII_change','GDP_change'], var_name = 'Change_Type', value_name = 'Value')\nGII = combined_data_time[(combined_data_time['Change_Type'] == 'GII_change')]                         \n\nGDP = combined_data_time[(combined_data_time['Change_Type'] == 'GDP_change')]\n\n# Stationary Check\ndef adf_test(series):\n    result = adfuller(series.dropna())\n    print(f'ADF Statistic: {result[0]}')\n    print(f'p-value: {result[1]}')\n    if result[1] &lt; 0.05:\n        print(\"Series is stationary\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Series is not stationary\")\n\n# Output the result\nadf_test(GII['Value'])\nadf_test(GDP['Value'])\n\nADF Statistic: -16.069430375623295\np-value: 5.527565277907626e-29\nSeries is stationary\nADF Statistic: -8.535683414310181\np-value: 1.0095278443825336e-13\nSeries is stationary\n\n\n\n\nVAR model: Examine variables separately\nWe fitted a VAR (Vector Autoreression) model to see the relationship between GII and GDP change. VAR is particularly useful when dealing with multivariate time series data and allows us to examine the interdependence between variables.\nBased on summary, here were several interpretations we could make:\n\nWe used AIC as the criteria for model selection. Lower value suggests a better fit.\nGiven that we wanted to predict GII change, we focused on the first set “Results for equation GII_change.”\nPast GII_change values significantly influenced current GII_change, as shown in the small p-values of lags 1 and 2.\nLag 2 of GDP_change had a relatively low p-value but is not statistically significant.\n\n\n# Split the dataset into training and testing sets\nsplit_ratio = 0.7\nsplit_index = int(len(combined_data) * split_ratio)\n\n# Training set is used to fit the model\ntrain_data = combined_data.iloc[:split_index]\n\n# Testing set is used for validation\ntest_data = combined_data.iloc[split_index:]\n\nprint(f\"Training data: {train_data.shape}\")\nprint(f\"Test data: {test_data.shape}\")\n\nTraining data: (639, 9)\nTest data: (275, 9)\n\n\n\n# Fit a VAR model \ntime_model = VAR(train_data[['GII_change', 'GDP_change']])\ntime_model_fitted = time_model.fit(maxlags = 15, ic=\"aic\")\n\n# Print out the model summary\nprint(time_model_fitted.summary())\n\n  Summary of Regression Results   \n==================================\nModel:                         VAR\nMethod:                        OLS\nDate:           Wed, 25, Dec, 2024\nTime:                     18:00:11\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nNo. of Equations:         2.00000    BIC:                   -12.2270\nNobs:                     636.000    HQIC:                  -12.2869\nLog likelihood:           2128.47    FPE:                4.43927e-06\nAIC:                     -12.3250    Det(Omega_mle):     4.34314e-06\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nResults for equation GII_change\n================================================================================\n                   coefficient       std. error           t-stat            prob\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nconst                -0.023760         0.003176           -7.481           0.000\nL1.GII_change         0.211342         0.039900            5.297           0.000\nL1.GDP_change        -0.015713         0.046080           -0.341           0.733\nL2.GII_change         0.111672         0.040402            2.764           0.006\nL2.GDP_change         0.088293         0.046452            1.901           0.057\nL3.GII_change        -0.021861         0.039774           -0.550           0.583\nL3.GDP_change         0.000651         0.046141            0.014           0.989\n================================================================================\n\nResults for equation GDP_change\n================================================================================\n                   coefficient       std. error           t-stat            prob\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nconst                 0.014585         0.002720            5.362           0.000\nL1.GII_change         0.004128         0.034171            0.121           0.904\nL1.GDP_change         0.141566         0.039464            3.587           0.000\nL2.GII_change        -0.009734         0.034600           -0.281           0.778\nL2.GDP_change         0.044282         0.039782            1.113           0.266\nL3.GII_change        -0.037787         0.034063           -1.109           0.267\nL3.GDP_change         0.143870         0.039516            3.641           0.000\n================================================================================\n\nCorrelation matrix of residuals\n              GII_change  GDP_change\nGII_change      1.000000    0.040992\nGDP_change      0.040992    1.000000\n\n\n\n\n\n/Users/sammi/Library/Caches/pypoetry/virtualenvs/imfp-0AlIckOY-py3.13/lib/python3.13/site-packages/statsmodels/tsa/base/tsa_model.py:473: ValueWarning: An unsupported index was provided.

The vertical axis is the percent change in Gender Inequality Index(GII). Different colors represent different countries. We used a linear regression line to display the overall pattern.\nBased on the scatterplot, it seems like there is a slight positive relationship between GDP change and GII change as shown by the flat regression line. Gender inequality is decreasing (gender equality is improving) a little faster in country-years with low GDP growth and a little slower in country-years with high GDP growth.\n\n# Drop NAs\ncombined_data = combined_data.dropna(subset=['GDP_change', 'GII_change'])\n\n# Plot the data points\nplt.figure(figsize=(18, 10))\nfor country in combined_data['Country'].unique():\n    country_data = combined_data[combined_data['Country'] == country]\n    plt.scatter(country_data['GDP_change'], country_data['GII_change'],\n             marker='o',linestyle='-', label=country)\nplt.title('Country-Year Analysis of GDP Change vs. GII Change')\nplt.xlabel('Percent Change in Real GDP per Capita (Country-Year)')\nplt.ylabel('Percent Change in GII (Country-Year)')\nplt.grid(True)\n\n# Prepare data for linear regression\nX = combined_data['GDP_change'].values.reshape(-1, 1)\ny = combined_data['GII_change'].values\n\n# Perform linear regression\nreg = LinearRegression().fit(X, y)\ny_pred = reg.predict(X)\n\n# Plot the regression line\nplt.plot(combined_data['GDP_change'], y_pred, color='red', linewidth=2)\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime Series Line Plot\nCreate separate line plots for GDP change and GII change over time for a few key countries might show the trends more clearly.\nUS: United States JP: Japan GB: United Kindom FR: France MX: Mexico\nBased on the line plots, we see GDP change and GII change have different patterns.

To provide a more informative view, we sequence countries in an ascending order by the median of percent change in GDP.\nThe boxplot displays a slight upward trend with no obvious pattern between GDP and GII change. In coutries with higher GDP change median, they also tend to have a larger spread of the GDP change. The median of GII change remains stable regardless of the magnitude of GDP change, implying weak or no association between GDP and GII change. We observe a potential outlier for country SI, Solvenia, which may explains its large improvement in Gender inequality.\n\n# Box plot for GII and GDP change\n# Melt the dataframe to long format for combined boxplot\ncombined_data_melted = combined_data.melt(id_vars=['Country'], value_vars=['GII_change', 'GDP_change'], \n                                          var_name='Change_Type', value_name='Value')\n\ngdp_medians = combined_data.groupby('Country')['GDP_change'].median().sort_values()\n\ncombined_data_melted['Country'] = pd.Categorical(combined_data_melted['Country'], categories=gdp_medians.index, ordered= True)\n\n# Prepare the plot structure\nplt.figure(figsize=(18, 10))\nsns.boxplot(data = combined_data_melted, x = \"Country\", y = 'Value', hue = 'Change_Type')\nplt.title('Distribution of GII and GDP change by Country')\nplt.xlabel('Country')\nplt.ylabel('Change')\nplt.legend(title = 'Change Type')\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrelation Matrix\nCreate a heatmap to show the relationship between GII and GDP change.\nA positive correlation coefficient indicates a positive relationship: the larger the GDP change, the larger the GII change. A negative correlation coefficient indicates a negative relationship: the larger the GDP change, the smaller the GII change. A correlation coefficient closer to 0 indicates there is weak or no relationship.\nBased on the numeric values in the plot, there is a moderately strong positive correlation between GII and GDP change for country Estonia(EE) and Ireland(IE).\n\n# Calculate the correlation\ncountry_correlation = combined_data.groupby('Country')[['GII_change', 'GDP_change']].corr().iloc[0::2, -1].reset_index(name='Correlation')\n\n# Put the correlation value in a matrix format\ncorrelation_matrix = country_correlation.pivot(index='Country', columns='level_1', values='Correlation')\n\n# Check for NaN values in the correlation matrix\ncorrelation_matrix.fillna(0, inplace=True)  # Replace NaNs with 0 or another value as appropriate\n\n# Set up the plot structure\nplt.figure(figsize=(18, 12))  # Adjust height to give more space for y-axis labels\n\n# Plot the heatmap\nsns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', center=0, cbar_kws={\"shrink\": .8}, linewidths=.5)\n\n# Enhance axis labels and title\nplt.title('Heatmap for GII and GDP Change', fontsize=20)\nplt.xlabel('Variables', fontsize=16)\nplt.ylabel('Country', fontsize=16)\n\n# Improve readability of y-axis labels\nplt.yticks(fontsize=12)  # Adjust the font size for y-axis labels\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()"

Only 0.4% of the variance in GII change can be explained by GDP change.\nWe are 95% confident that the interval from -0.003 to 0.169 captures the true slope of GDP change.

VAR is particularly useful when dealing with multivariate time series data and allows us to examine the interdependence between variables.\nBased on summary, here are several interpretations we can make: - We used AIC as the criteria for model selection. Lower value suggests a better fit. - Given that we want to predict GII change, we will focus on the first set “Results for equation GII_change.” - Past GII_change values significantly influence current GII_change, as shown in the small p-values of lags 1 and 2. - Lag 2 of GDP_change has a relatively low p-value but is not statistically significant.\n\n# Split the dataset into training and testing sets\nsplit_ratio = 0.7\nsplit_index = int(len(combined_data) * split_ratio)\n\n# Training set is used to fit the model\ntrain_data = combined_data.iloc[:split_index]\n\n# Testing set is used for validation\ntest_data = combined_data.iloc[split_index:]\n\nprint(f\"Training data: {train_data.shape}\")\nprint(f\"Test data: {test_data.shape}\")\n\nTraining data: (639, 9)\nTest data: (275, 9)\n\n\n\n# Fit a VAR model \ntime_model = VAR(train_data[['GII_change', 'GDP_change']])\ntime_model_fitted = time_model.fit(maxlags = 15, ic=\"aic\")\n\n# Print out the model summary\nprint(time_model_fitted.summary())\n\n  Summary of Regression Results   \n==================================\nModel:                         VAR\nMethod:                        OLS\nDate:           Wed, 25, Dec, 2024\nTime:                     16:32:06\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nNo. of Equations:         2.00000    BIC:                   -12.2270\nNobs:                     636.000    HQIC:                  -12.2869\nLog likelihood:           2128.47    FPE:                4.43927e-06\nAIC:                     -12.3250    Det(Omega_mle):     4.34314e-06\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nResults for equation GII_change\n================================================================================\n                   coefficient       std. error           t-stat            prob\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nconst                -0.023760         0.003176           -7.481           0.000\nL1.GII_change         0.211342         0.039900            5.297           0.000\nL1.GDP_change        -0.015713         0.046080           -0.341           0.733\nL2.GII_change         0.111672         0.040402            2.764           0.006\nL2.GDP_change         0.088293         0.046452            1.901           0.057\nL3.GII_change        -0.021861         0.039774           -0.550           0.583\nL3.GDP_change         0.000651         0.046141            0.014           0.989\n================================================================================\n\nResults for equation GDP_change\n================================================================================\n                   coefficient       std. error           t-stat            prob\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nconst                 0.014585         0.002720            5.362           0.000\nL1.GII_change         0.004128         0.034171            0.121           0.904\nL1.GDP_change         0.141566         0.039464            3.587           0.000\nL2.GII_change        -0.009734         0.034600           -0.281           0.778\nL2.GDP_change         0.044282         0.039782            1.113           0.266\nL3.GII_change        -0.037787         0.034063           -1.109           0.267\nL3.GDP_change         0.143870         0.039516            3.641           0.000\n================================================================================\n\nCorrelation matrix of residuals\n              GII_change  GDP_change\nGII_change      1.000000    0.040992\nGDP_change      0.040992    1.000000\n\n\n\n\n\n/Users/sammi/Library/Caches/pypoetry/virtualenvs/imfp-0AlIckOY-py3.13/lib/python3.13/site-packages/statsmodels/tsa/base/tsa_model.py:473: ValueWarning: An unsupported index was provided.

    "text": "Data Preparation\n​​To explore how economic growth connects with gender equality, we turned to the Imfp library to access a wealth of global economic data, ready to analyze through some straightforward API calls. Let’s break down our two main variables of interest. Here’s the lowdown on the 4 key data series we pulled together:\n\n\nDependent Variable: Percent Change in Gender Inequality Index (GII)\nOur gender equality measure, the Gender Inequality Index (GII), is a composite score that reflects inequality in three key areas: reproductive health, empowerment, and labor market, ranging from 0 (equality) to 1 (inequality). We calculated the percent change in GII over time to make it easier to compare GII change across countries with different baseline levels of inequality.\n\n\nIndependent Variable: Percent Change in Real GDP per capita\nOur economic growth measure is real GDP per capita, an indicator of a country’s economic output per person, adjusted for inflation. The higher the real GDP per capita, the wealthier and more prosperous a country is. Here is a peek at the formula:"

    "section": "Data Visualization",
    "text": "Data Visualization\n\nScatterplot\nNothing like a good scatterplot to help us understand the relationship between two numbers, right? For our project, the scatterplot lets us visually explore how Percent Change in Real GDP per capita relates to Percent Change in GII. Each dot on the plot represents a country-year combo. The gentle upward slope suggests that in years of low GDP growth, gender inequality tends to decrease a bit faster, while in years of high GDP growth, the inequality drops at a slightly slower rate. It’s a subtle clue, but slower-growing economies might be making slightly quicker strides in gender equality.\n \n\n\nTime Series Line plot\nThe time series line plot gives us the big picture of GDP and GII changes over time across a few select countries, including the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, France, and Mexico. Mexico, for example, saw great GDP swings in 1995, yet its GII stayed relatively stable. Meanwhile, Japan and France saw some dramatic GII shifts. These fluctuations leave us wondering: what historical events sparked these changes? We may need to take a deeper look into each country’s unique timeline to find the answers.\n \n\n\nBoxplot\nNext, we have the boxplot to help us visualize the distribution. By sequencing countries in ascending order of median GDP change, we see an interesting trend: countries with higher median GDP growth also seem to show more variability in their GDP changes. The GII change, on the other hand, keeps a relatively stable median, hinting at a weaker association with GDP growth.\n \n\n\nHeatmap\nFinally, our heatmap wraps it all up with a quick, intuitive look at correlations between GDP and GII across countries. In countries like Estonia (EE) and Ireland (IE), Australia (AT), South Africa (ZA), Thailand (TH), Slovenia (SI), we see positive correlations in warm colors, indicating that as GDP growth rates increase, GII growth rates tend to rise as well. For countries like Cyprus (CY), Romania (RO), and the United States (US), we see cooler colors, representing negative correlations: as GDP growth rate rises, GII growth rates decrease, suggesting an improvement in gender equality alongside economic growth. This color-coded comparison leaves us curious—could the distinction between developed and developing countries play a role in these relationships? It’s a question that might inspire future research directions!"

    "section": "Statistical Analysis",
    "text": "Statistical Analysis\n\nDescriptive Statistics\nLet’s start with a quick overview of our descriptive statistics: our dataset includes 915 data points. On average, GII change is -3.15%, indicating an overall reduction in gender inequality over time. Meanwhile, GDP change averages 2.35%, hinting at modest economic growth. A full breakdown of these values can be found in the table below for more detail.\n\n\n\nRegression Analysis\nTo get a sense of any relationship between GDP change and GII change, we ran a simple linear regression. Here’s what we found:\n\nP-value: With a p-value of 0.057, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is no statistically significant relationship. In other words, we don’t find strong evidence of a link between GDP and GII changes.\nR-squared: GDP change explains only 0.4% of the variation in GII change—a pretty minimal effect.\n95% Confidence Interval: We’re 95% confident the interval from -0.003 to 0.169 captures the true slope.

Here’s the rundown:\n\nStationarity check: Both GII and GDP change series are stationary, meaning their means and variances are stable over time, setting us up for reliable forecasting.\nVAR Model (Vector Autoregression): This multivariate model lets us explore how past values in both series relate to current values. Notably, past GII changes significantly impact current GII changes.\nModel Performance: The VAR model has good fit, as shown by the forecast closely tracking actual values. Low MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) confirm that our model predicts GII and GDP change with minimal error. Check out the plots and table below!\nGranger Causality Test: Curious whether GDP changes can predict changes in GII? The Granger causality test says no. With p-values above 0.05, we fail to find evidence that GDP changes drive GII changes. This suggests that while both variables evolve over time, they don’t seem to directly influence each other."

    "text": "Data Preparation\n​​To explore how economic growth connects with gender equality, we turned to the Imfp library to access a wealth of global economic data, ready to analyze through some straightforward API calls. Let’s break down our two main variables of interest. Here’s the lowdown on the 4 key data series we pulled together:\n\n\nDependent Variable: Percent Change in Gender Inequality Index (GII)\nOur gender equality measure, the Gender Inequality Index (GII), is a composite score that reflects inequality in three key areas: reproductive health, empowerment, and labor market, ranging from 0 (equality) to 1 (inequality). We calculated the percent change in GII over time to make it easier to compare GII change across countries with different baseline levels of inequality.\n\n\nIndependent Variable: Percent Change in Real GDP per capita\nOur economic growth measure is real GDP per capita, an indicator of a country’s economic output per person, adjusted for inflation. The higher the real GDP per capita, the wealthier and more prosperous a country is. Here is a peek at the formula:"

    "text": "Data Visualization\n\nScatterplot\nNothing like a good scatterplot to help us understand the relationship between two numbers, right? For our project, the scatterplot lets us visually explore how Percent Change in Real GDP per capita relates to Percent Change in GII. Each dot on the plot represents a country-year combo. The gentle upward slope suggests that in years of low GDP growth, gender inequality tends to decrease a bit faster, while in years of high GDP growth, the inequality drops at a slightly slower rate. It’s a subtle clue, but slower-growing economies might be making slightly quicker strides in gender equality.\n \n\n\nTime Series Line plot\nThe time series line plot gives us the big picture of GDP and GII changes over time across a few select countries, including the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, France, and Mexico. Mexico, for example, saw great GDP swings in 1995, yet its GII stayed relatively stable. Meanwhile, Japan and France saw some dramatic GII shifts. These fluctuations leave us wondering: what historical events sparked these changes? We may need to take a deeper look into each country’s unique timeline to find the answers.\n \n\n\nBoxplot\nNext, we have the boxplot to help us visualize the distribution. By sequencing countries in ascending order of median GDP change, we see an interesting trend: countries with higher median GDP growth also seem to show more variability in their GDP changes. The GII change, on the other hand, keeps a relatively stable median, hinting at a weaker association with GDP growth.\n \n\n\nHeatmap\nFinally, our heatmap wraps it all up with a quick, intuitive look at correlations between GDP and GII across countries. In countries like Estonia (EE) and Ireland (IE), Australia (AT), South Africa (ZA), Thailand (TH), Slovenia (SI), we see positive correlations in warm colors, indicating that as GDP growth rates increase, GII growth rates tend to rise as well. For countries like Cyprus (CY), Romania (RO), and the United States (US), we see cooler colors, representing negative correlations: as GDP growth rate rises, GII growth rates decrease, suggesting an improvement in gender equality alongside economic growth. This color-coded comparison leaves us curious—could the distinction between developed and developing countries play a role in these relationships? It’s a question that might inspire future research directions!"

On average, GII change is -3.15%, indicating an overall reduction in gender inequality over time. Meanwhile, GDP change averages 2.35%, hinting at modest economic growth. A full breakdown of these values can be found in the table below for more detail.\n\n\n\nRegression Analysis\nTo get a sense of any relationship between GDP change and GII change, we ran a simple linear regression. Here’s what we found:\n\nP-value: With a p-value of 0.057, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is no statistically significant relationship. In other words, we don’t find strong evidence of a link between GDP and GII changes.\nR-squared: GDP change explains only 0.4% of the variation in GII change—a pretty minimal effect.\n95% Confidence Interval: We’re 95% confident the interval from -0.003 to 0.169 captures the true slope.
