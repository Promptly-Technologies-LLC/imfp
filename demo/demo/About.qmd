Hi there! My name is Jenny, and I'm a third-year student at University of California, Davis, double majoring in Statistics and Psychology. I've always been interested in becoming a data analyst working in tech, internet, or research industries. Interning at Promptly Technologies helped me learn a ton. A quick fun fact for me is that my MBTI is ISFJ (Defender)!
