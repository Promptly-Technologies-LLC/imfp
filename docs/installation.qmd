## Basic Installation

To install the stable version of imfp from PyPi using pip:

```bash
pip install -q --upgrade imfp
```

You can then import the package in your Python script:

```python
import imfp
```

## Dependencies for Data Analysis

`imfp` outputs data in a `pandas` data frame, so you will want to use the `pandas` package for its functions for viewing and manipulating this object type. For data analysis and visualization, we recommend installing these additional packages:

```bash
pip install -q pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy
```

You can then import them in your Python script:

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np
```

## Development Installation

If you want to contribute to `imfp` development:

1. Fork and clone the repository
2. Install [uv](https://astral.sh/setup-uv/) with `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
3. Install the dependencies with `uv sync --extra dev`
4. Install the git hook for conventional commits:
   ```bash
   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tapsellorg/conventional-commits-git-hook/master/scripts/install.sh | sh
   ```

For documentation development, you'll also need to install the [Quarto CLI tool](https://quarto.org/docs/download/).
