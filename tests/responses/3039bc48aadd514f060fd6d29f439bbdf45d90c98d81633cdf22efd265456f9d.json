Todas las otras monedas se incluyen en la categoría “otras monedas”.  Antes de la introducción del euro en 1999, varias monedas europeas se identificaban por separado en la COFER: unidad de cuenta europea, marco alemán, franco francés y florín neerlandés.

Se trata de activos de reserva distintos del oro monetario, los DEG y la posición de reserva en el FMI, y consisten en los siguientes tipos de derechos de las autoridades monetarias frente a no residentes: moneda y depósitos, títulos, derivados financieros, y otros derechos sobre activos.         Reservas de divisas asignadas: en el contexto de la COFER, Reservas de divisas (FXR) asignadas es la categoría en que los países declarantes identifican y declaran la moneda de denominación de sus FXR.  Reservas de divisas no asignadas: en el contexto de la COFER, Reservas de divisas (FXR) no asignadas es una categoría residual de la COFER que consiste en la diferencia entre las FXR totales obtenidas de las estadísticas financieras internacionales (EFI) y las reservas asignadas totales en la COFER. Tiene dos componentes: i) las FXR totales de países no declarantes; y ii) la discrepancia (si la hubiere) entre las FXR totales de las EFI de los países que declaran a la COFER y las FXR asignadas totales en la COFER.\",\"fr\":\"L’ensemble de données sur la composition monétaire des réserves officielles de change (COFER) comprend les réserves officielles de change ventilées par monnaie. Les monnaies recensées dans l’ensemble de données COFER sont les suivantes : dollar américain, livre sterling, yen japonais, francs suisses, dollar canadien, dollar australien, renminbi chinois et euro.  Toutes les autres monnaies sont incluses dans la catégorie «autres monnaies».  Avant l’adoption de l’euro en 1999, plusieurs monnaies européennes étaient classées séparément dans la COFER : l’unité monétaire européenne (ECU), le deutsche mark, le franc français et le florin néerlandais. Les données COFER sont communiquées au FMI sur une base volontaire et confidentielle par les banques centrales de plus de 140 pays. Les données COFER pour les différents pays sont strictement confidentielles. À l’heure actuelle, il y a 149 déclarants, dont les autorités monétaires des pays membres du FMI et des pays/économies non membres du FMI ; et d’autres entités détenant des réserves de change. La COFER comprend une liste des pays participants qui ont accepté de divulguer leurs noms. Les pays qui souscrivent à la NSDDS Plus sont tenus de contribuer à la base de données COFER et de déclarer publiquement leur participation. Les données publiées sur ce site sont des agrégats pour chaque monnaie du monde, des pays avancés, des pays émergents et des pays en développement. À partir du deuxième trimestre 2015, le FMI a décidé de suspendre la publication de ces deux derniers groupes de pays afin d’éviter une éventuelle divulgation par recoupement de données individuelles avec la publication de la liste des pays qui ont accepté de publier leur nom en tant que déclarants COFER.   Les estimations des réserves officielles de change sont essentielles au bon fonctionnement des systèmes financiers nationaux et internationaux.   Les données sur les réserves de change recueillies par l’enquête COFER sont conformes à la classification « autres avoirs de réserve » telle que décrite dans la sixième édition du Manuel de la balance des paiements et de la position extérieure globale (MBP6) du FMI. Il s’agit d’actifs de réserve autres que l’or monétaire, les DTS et la position de réserve au FMI ; et constituent des créances des autorités monétaires sur les non-résidents sous la forme de : numéraire et dépôts, valeurs mobilières, dérivés financiers et autres créances.   Réserves de change affectées : dans le cadre de la COFER, les réserves de change (FXR) affectées sont la catégorie COFER dans laquelle les pays déclarants recensent et déclarent la monnaie de libellé de leur réserves de change. Réserves de change non affectées : dans le cadre de la COFER, les réserves de change (FXR) non affectées sont une catégorie résiduelle de la COFER constituée de la différence entre le total des FXR provenant des Statistiques financières internationales (SFI) et le total des réserves affectées dans la COFER. Elles incluent deux composantes : i) le total des FXR des pays non déclarants ; et ii) l’écart (le cas échéant) entre le total des FXR des pays déclarants de la COFER qui figurent dans les SFI et le total des FXR affectées dans la COFER.\",\"ja\":\"公的外貨準備の通貨別構成（COFER）データセットは、通貨別の公的外貨準備高を内容としている。  COFERデータセットにおいて特定される通貨は、米ドル、英ポンド、日本円、スイスフラン、カナダドル、豪ドル、中国人民元、ユーロである。  その他の通貨はすべて、「他通貨」のカテゴリーに組み入れられている。  1999年のユーロ導入以前は、COFERでは複数の欧州通貨が別々に特定されていた（欧州通貨単位、独マルク、仏フラン、蘭ギルダー）。  COFERデータは、140を超える国・地域の中央銀行により自発的かつ非公開でIMFに報告されている。各国のCOFERデータは、極秘情報とされている。現時点で、IMF加盟および非加盟国・地域の通貨当局やその他の外貨準備保有組織の計149機関から報告を受けている。COFERには、国・地域名の開示に合意した参加国・地域のリストが含まれている。SDDSプラス採用国には、COFERデータベースに参加し、その参加を開示することが求められている。本ウェブサイトに公開されているデータは、全世界、先進国、新興市場国・発展途上国について、通貨別に集計されたものである。IMFは、COFER報告国として国名を開示することに合意した国のリストの公開に伴う個別データの残差開示の可能性を回避するために、2015年第2四半期以降、新興市場国と発展途上国の地理的内訳の公表を停止することを決定した。   公的外貨準備高推計値は、国内および国際金融システムの円滑な機能にとって極めて重要である。    COFERに報告される外貨準備（FXR）データは、「IMF国際収支・国際投資ポジションマニュアル」第6版（BPM6）に概要が示されている準備資産分類の「その他準備資産」と一致している。これらは、貨幣用金、SDR、IMFにおける準備ポジション以外の準備資産であり、現金と預金、証券、金融派生商品、およびその他の債権の形での通貨当局の非居住者に対する債権で構成される。         割当外貨準備：COFERにおいては、割当外貨準備は、報告国が外貨準備の通貨単位を特定して報告するCOFERのカテゴリーである。  非割当外貨準備：COFERにおいては、非割当外貨準備は、国際金融統計（IFS）に基づく外貨準備総額とCOFERの割当準備総額の差額から成るCOFERの残余カテゴリーである。これには、(i)非報告国の外貨準備総額と、(ii)IFSに基づくCOFER報告国の外貨準備総額とCOFERの割当外貨準備総額の差異（存在する場合）のふたつの構成要素が含まれる。\",\"pt\":\"O conjunto de dados da composição por moeda das reservas cambiais oficiais, ou COFER na sigla em inglês, apresenta as reservas cambiais oficiais discriminadas por moeda.

Os dados da COFER relativos a países individuais são estritamente confidenciais. Atualmente, os dados são reportados pelas autoridades monetárias de países membros do FMI e de países/economias não membros do FMI, e por outras entidades detentoras de reservas cambiais, num total de 149 países declarantes.

Os dados publicados no respetivo sítio web são agregados por moeda e cobrem o mundo, as economias avançadas e as economias de mercados emergentes e em desenvolvimento. A partir do segundo trimestre de 2015, o FMI decidiu pôr fim à publicação destas duas últimas categorias geográficas, com o objetivo de evitar a divulgação residual de dados individuais com a divulgação da lista dos países participantes que autorizaram a publicação dos respetivos nomes no sítio web da COFER. As estimativas da composição por moeda das reservas cambiais oficiais são críticas para o bom funcionamento dos sistemas financeiros nacionais e internacionais.  Os dados das reservas cambiais reportados no sítio web da COFER estão em linha com a classificação “Outros ativos de reserva”, conforme estabelecido na sexta edição do Manual de Balança de Pagamentos e Posição de Investimento Internacional (BPM6) do FMI. Esta abrange todos os ativos de reserva que não o ouro monetário, os direitos de saque especiais e a posição de reserva no FMI, e inclui os créditos sobre não residentes das autoridades monetárias sob a forma de: numerário e depósitos, títulos, derivados financeiros e outros créditos.  Reservas cambiais atribuídas: no contexto da COFER, as reservas cambiais atribuídas representam a categoria COFER utilizada pelos países declarantes para identificar e declarar a moeda de denominação das suas reservas cambiais.  Reservas cambiais não atribuídas: no contexto da COFER, as reservas cambiais não atribuídas representam uma categoria residual da COFER resultante da diferença entre as reservas cambiais totais compiladas nas Estatísticas Financeiras Internacionais (IFS) e as reservas totais atribuídas no COFER.

В наборе данных ВСОВР отдельно представляются следующие валюты: доллар США, фунт стерлингов, японская иена, швейцарский франк, канадский доллар, австралийский доллар, китайский юань и евро. Все остальные валюты включаются в категорию «прочие валюты». До введения евро в 1999 году в ВСОВР отдельно представлялись несколько европейских валют: европейская валютная единица (ЭКЮ), немецкая марка, французский франк и нидерландский гульден.  Данные ВСОВР предоставляются в МВФ на добровольной и конфиденциальной основе центральными банками более 140 стран и территорий. Данные ВСОВР по конкретным странам строго конфиденциальны. В настоящее время насчитывается 149 сторон, представляющих данные, в число которых входят органы денежно-кредитного регулирования стран-членов МВФ и стран/территорий, не являющихся членами МВФ, а также другие структуры, хранящие валютные резервы. ВСОВР включает перечень участвующих стран, которые выразили согласие на раскрытие информации о своем участии. Страны, использующие ССРД-плюс, обязаны участвовать в базе данных ВСОВР и раскрывать информацию о своем участии. Данные, публикуемые на этом веб-сайте, представляют собой данные по каждой валюте, агрегированные для мира в целом, стран с развитой экономикой и стран с формирующимся рынком и развивающихся стран. Начиная со II квартала 2015 года МВФ принял решение о прекращении публикации двух последних географических разбивок, чтобы избежать возможного раскрытия индивидуальных данных как остатка при публикации списка стран, выразивших свое согласие на раскрытие информации о своем представлении данных в ВСОВР. Оценки официальных валютных резервов имеют принципиальное значение для бесперебойного функционирования национальных и международной финансовых систем.  Данные о валютных резервах (ВР), представляемые в ВСОВР, соответствуют классификации резервных активов категории «прочие резервные активы», установленной в шестом издании «Руководства по платежному балансу и международной инвестиционной позиции» МВФ (РПБ6). Это резервные активы, кроме монетарного золота, СДР и резервной позиции в МВФ, и они состоят из требований органов денежно-кредитного регулирования к нерезидентам в форме: наличной валюты и депозитов, ценных бумаг, производных финансовых инструментов и прочих требований.  Распределенные валютные резервы: в контексте ВСОВР распределенные ВР — это категория ВСОВР, в которой страны, представляющие данные, отдельно сообщают данные о своих валютных резервах и указывают валюту их деноминации.  Нераспределенные валютные резервы: в контексте ВСОВР нераспределенные ВР — это остаточная категория ВСОВР, представляющая собой разность между общей суммой ВР, полученных из данных Международной финансовой статистики (МФС), и общей суммой распределенных резервов в ВСОВР.
